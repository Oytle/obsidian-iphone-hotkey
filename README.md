# Obsidian iPhone Hotkeys
useful hotkey for taking note with external keyboard + iPhone. I made this as I uses autohotkey in Windows for shortcuts, iPhone don't have this, so we need a Obsidian Nested-in method.

# Useful combination that could be defined
It's possible to define the following very useful combination:
- Capslock + i/j/k/l == Up/Left/Down/Right
- Capslock + Alt(cmd) + i/j/k/l == Shift + Up/Left/Down/Right (for selection)
- Capslock + u/o == {Left * 4} / {Right * 4}
etc.

# Install
1. Install the BRAT (Community plugins)
2. Add beta theme, paste this github URL.
3. Done!
