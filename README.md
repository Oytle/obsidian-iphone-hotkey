# Obsidian iPhone Hotkeys
useful hotkey for taking note with external keyboard + iPhone. I made this as I uses autohotkey in Windows for shortcuts, iPhone don't have this, so we need a Obsidian Nested-in method.

# Useful combination that could be defined
It's possible to define the following very useful combinations:
- Capslock + i/j/k/l == Up/Left/Down/Right
- Capslock + Alt(cmd) + i/j/k/l == Shift + Up/Left/Down/Right (for selection)
- Capslock + u/o == {Left * 4} / {Right * 4}
etc.

But NOTE:
- As the default hotkeys are very carefully designed for iPhone only, they collide HEAVILY with the default hotkeys of obsidian.
	- So you may want to adjust the default hotkeys of obsidian manually to adapt the best setup of this plugin.
 	- If used in Windows without autohotkey, you may need to adjust both the default of this plugin and obsidian.
- You may also need to adjust the iPhone - External keyboard aux keys binding.
	- suggestion: rebind CapsLock (External Kbd) to Ctrl (iPhone).
